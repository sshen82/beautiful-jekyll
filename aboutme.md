My name is Siqi Shen. I am a Ph.D. student working with Prof. Sündüz Keleş. I have a broad range of interests including all sorts of statistical genomics methods, high dimensional statistics, geometric data analysis, and topological data analysis, etc. Right now, I am working on statistical methods for single cell Hi-C data.
